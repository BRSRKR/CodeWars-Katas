#----------
#There are pillars near the road. The distance between the pillars is the same and the width of the pillars is the same. Your function accepts three arguments:
#
#number of pillars (â‰¥ 1);
#distance between pillars (10 - 30 meters);
#width of the pillar (10 - 50 centimeters).
#Calculate the distance between the first and the last pillar in centimeters (without the width of the first and last pillar).
#----------
